      Description: "References an instance of a ruleset model with a unique ruleset_model_type."
      Data Type: "[{RulesetModelInstance}]"
      Notes: "For submissions with ruleset model instances (i.e., user, proposed, baseline,..) generated as separate files, only one instance would be defined for each ASHRAE229 RMD json file. For submissions where the software always produces all ruleset model instances together, multiple ruleset model instances would appear in the same ASHRAE229 RMD json file. Some rulesets may restrict the submission process including the number of files and number of instances per file. Multiple model instances may be required by rulesets that require models at various tiers or levels of performance. Instances may also be used by References between data groups are restricted to be within the same ruleset model instance. For 90.1-2019 appendix G instances would be created for the following models: user, proposed, baseline at 0 degrees, baseline at 90 degrees, baseline at 180 degrees, and baseline at 270 degrees. All IDs within a RulesetModelInstance should be unique for each type of data group. Between Ruleset ModelInstances, IDs should be the same for the same component. For example, a Surface with an ID of LobbyFrontSurface is very likely to have the same geometry for all RulesetModelInstances except perhaps the azimuth so that surface should have the ID LobbyFrontSurface for all RulesetModelInstances.

      Notes: "A factor that has already been applied when modeling a zone that represents an aggregation of several individual zones shown on design documents. For example, if five dwelling units facing the same orientation are modeled as a single zone, the total volume of the zone and the total surface area of the zone should be five times the values of a single dwelling unit shown on the design documents and aggregation_factor should be set to 5. Another example, when three identical floors are modeled, the zones modeled for these floors should represent the volume of the zone on three floors, and the aggregation_factor should be set to 3. A final example would be a big box retail store with eight units serving the core zone, the total floor area of the spaces in the core zone should already account for the total area, and the aggregation_factor should be set to 8. The factor is chiefly used to determine the size range for heating and cooling equipment serving that zone. Used only to confirm the individual size of heating or cooling units serving the zone so that the efficiency for that size range can be looked up in tables of equipment efficiency by size range. By dividing the heating and cooling capacity of the zone by the aggregation_factor, the result would indicate the capacity of the individual units represented by equipment. For zones not representing any type of aggregation, this value should be one. The aggregation_factor is typically an integer but occasionally may include a fractional value. The total area of the spaces and the volume of the zone should already be multiplied by the factor."
