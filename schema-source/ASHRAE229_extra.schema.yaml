    ruleset_model_instances:  
      Description: "References an instance of a ruleset model with a unique ruleset_model_type."
      Data Type: "[{RulesetModelInstance}]"
      Notes: "For submissions with ruleset model instances (i.e., user, proposed, baseline,..) generated as separate files, only one instance would be defined for each ASHRAE229 RMD json file. For submissions where the software always produces all ruleset model instances together, multiple ruleset model instances would appear in the same ASHRAE229 RMD json file. Some rulesets may restrict the submission process including the number of files and number of instances per file. References between data groups are restricted to be within the same ruleset model instance. For 90.1-2019 appendix G instances would be created for the following models: user, proposed, baseline at 0 degrees, baseline at 90 degrees, baseline at 180 degrees, and baseline at 270 degrees. All IDs within a RulesetModelInstance should be unique for each type of data group. Between Ruleset ModelInstances, IDs should be the same for the same component. For example, a Surface with an ID of LobbyFrontSurface is very likely to have the same geometry for all RulesetModelInstances except perhaps the azimuth so that surface should have the ID LobbyFrontSurface for all RulesetModelInstances.
